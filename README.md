LocalLens SL 🌍

Your Gateway to Authentic Sri Lankan Experiences

LocalLens SL is a mobile application prototype built as a university project to help travelers discover authentic, hyper-local experiences in Sri Lanka, offered directly by local hosts and small independent operators.

Instead of generic tour packages, LocalLens SL focuses on niche, cultural, and community-driven experiences such as village cooking classes, hidden hiking trails, craft workshops, wildlife spotting, and photography walks.

🚀 Project Overview

Platform: Mobile (Android / iOS – via Expo)

Development Approach: Solo developer

Goal: Validate the idea of AI-assisted discovery for experiential tourism in Sri Lanka

This MVP focuses on discovery and inquiry only — no in-app payments or bookings.
